The field of software engineering is constantly developing. With tech, frameworks, and programming best practices changing every dayâ€”even the best developers risk falling behind. 

Nobody really wants to dedicate large chunks of their time to continued education. We get that. Fortunately, the internet is littered with developer blogs. And, while we here at CometChat are anti-littering, we are definitely pro-innovation, pro-growth and pro-learning from the trials and errors of others so we don't have to waste time ourselves.

If you're part of team "Never Stop Learning", check out some of our favorite developer blogs:
